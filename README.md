## This is a modify version of the classic game pong.
The basic code is made by MFLeon27 on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K2mnjoCNXw&list=FLvMWSRiXMc0lICP0nPTuEwg&index=1&t=1100s

His code and my code are combined, there will be a seperate code folder that will only have his code, and the main code folder will show both my code and his code.

I would consider this project mostly done. Quite frankly a lot more features could be added but I did the best I could and I did fullfill part of what I said I would add in my Preposal.md.
## Mods
There are three balls. Two balls are normal and the other ball(red) makes a player lose a point when it touches the paddle.

The balls can bounce off each other and a barrier block in the middle making their paths more unpredictable.

The paddles constantly changes size making the game a little harder.

##Codes

There are 6 sections of code

Ball,paddles,goal,paddleSize,PaddleDie,Gamanager, each section has comments that says what each section do
