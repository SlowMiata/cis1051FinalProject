# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. a diet plan tracker, it can track the food you eat and the macros. Can select a certain diet plan if wanted, and the app will warn you if you consuming too much of a macro or not ( carbs,fat, etc)
  (based off MyFitnessPal) ( will be the hardest to do, espically alone)
2. text based RPG
3.something with pygame
4 no clue but something with real world applications
 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A (doing this alone)



## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is my first idea something that seems resonable, and doable on python? If yes, how would I be able to present this, should it be an app or website etc.
