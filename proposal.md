# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong 2: The Pongwerful 
	    (powerfuL) 


TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")


Its a game of pong that gets progressively harder as the game goes on. The speed of the ball(s) with increase and there will be power ups.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using Unity, I will make a 2d pong game, buts that already done. So basically what I will be doing is a mod, that will add more balls and create new power ups in the game.
As time goes on, the speed of the ball will increase until the someone scores a point. I will create different powerups that if the ball touches, it will make the ball have different feature.
It could become smaller, bigger. The paddles could chagne sizes as well, or they could increase or decrease in speed.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working version of pong, that will be done no matter what. A good outcome for my project is that I would have at least made one or two powerups.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is that I have most the powerups in the game and the game actaully works. I think I could add the powerups but this will take time since this is in a language Im not all too famliar with, so I have to do some learning first

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome is I do everything I wanted to do with powerups and the game actaully works. I hope that I can implement some of my own codes, so that I what I submit isn't considered plagraism. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I have download unity, and learn how to navigate it. I will then what videos on how to make a pong game or at least a 2d game. I also have to learn how to code in C# or C++. I will have to research the differnt functions that C# and how to properly implement them into my game.
